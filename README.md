# medVQA

This repository provides the code for our method, a model capable of Medical Visual Question Answering by leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Large Language Models for pre-training and fine-tuning on multimodal models. For more details, please refer to our paper: [Paper]

We provide the data needed for training [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oICfuuRDst6jJkE2jBzTYL0guo7aGd8S?usp=sharing
), including:

1. JSON format data for the train and test sets in the PMC-VQA dataset (pmcvqa_train.json & pmcvqa_test.json).
2. Visual features of images used in the train and test sets of the PMC-VQA dataset (vision_features/).
3. Checkpoints for the first phase of training QCM-LE and the second phase of training QCMG-A (checkpoints/).
4. The Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) json on the PMC-VQA test set, generated by the Med-CoE model (test_cot.json).
